# labscript-suite-bitbucket-archive

This organisation conatins copies of all public BitBucket forks of the labscript suite project repositories, as of 1st February, 2020.

This archive was made so that a record of custom code and rejected pull requests was preserved after BitBucket dropped mercurial support in mid-2020.

An archive of the BitBucket website can be found [here](https://bitbucket-archive.labscriptsuite.org) (hosted with GitHub pages from [this](https://github.com/labscript-suite/labscript-suite-bitbucket-archive) repository)
